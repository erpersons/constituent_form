Code Challenge for MN Senate
Constituent Contact Form Problem
Web Developer
Minnesota Senate
Solution Due: December 20, 2017 by 5PM
~~~~~~
Please complete this problem using whatever coding language you feel most comfortable – PHP and
Node.js are currently used within the department.
The Senators have asked the programmers to make it easier for constituents to contact them on the
web. They would like one form that allows constituents to contact their Senator through by first
selecting their Senator or District.
After picking the criteria of Senator or District, the constituent can enter their name, phone number,
mail address, email address, and short message to their Senator. They will also need to click a checkbox
to prove they are human.
After they click submit, this message will be sent to the Senator’s email while also stored in the IT
database to allow for better analysis of constituent interaction later.
Assumptions:
• There is a table that stores all Senator’s information, including which District this Senator
represents.
• There is a table that stores all District information.
• The tables to store the analysis information already exists.
